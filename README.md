# LMS_Internship_PRSA
R and C code for performing Population Resampling Based Stochastic Approximation(PRSA) to fit Gaussian process regression models, written during my internship at Durham University which was funded by the London Mathematical Society. 

## Directions for use
1. Set the R's working directory to the directory containing the C directory
2. Run the file RSA_Parallel_Multivariate.r
3. Use the function RSA.parallel.multi to fit the Gaussian process
4. Use the function predict.rsa.multi.local to make predictions to new data using the fitted Gaussian process
